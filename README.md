## Releases

Releases are tagged for reference (based on usage in the guide). **Releases in this repository are not intended to be for general use.** If you want to use them regardless:
- Clone this repository (latest commit, or a tagged release if you are looking for a specific version)
- Copy the contents of `finalize` to the root of your console's SD card
- Copy `finalize.gm9` from the `finalize` folder to `/gm9/scripts/`
- Copy `GodMode9.firm` from the `finalize` folder to `/luma/payloads/`
    - Create any folders that do not exist
    - Luma's `boot.firm` needs to be on root of SD for this to work

`finalize_helper` is not necessary unless you intend to use the RomFS build.


## Building

You need the following tools installed on your computer:
- [3dstool](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool/releases/latest)
- [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
    - devkitARM is only required if you are building the FIRM, which you are going to want to anyway
    - Install the 3DS related packages

Clone the repository via the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/hacks-guide/finalize --recurse-submodules
cd finalize
```

And build:
```
make
```

The romfs and FIRM will be present in the `builds` directory.
